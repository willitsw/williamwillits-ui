        I am a classical musician turned software engineer with a passion for
        creativity, problem solving, collaboration, and lifelong learning. I am
        a hard-working, creative problem solver, and I pride myself on being
        able to deliver as both a technologist and as a business-minded person
        who can see the larger picture. As a former teacher, I have built strong
        communication skills, and can collaborate well with people from all
        backgrounds and skill-sets.
